**Introduction To Python**
It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
Python is a High Level, Interpreted and Object Oriented programming language.
What is a Programming Language?
It is a set of instructions given to computer to get the desired output.

Programming languages can be broadly classified as 2 types:

High Level programming language.
Low Level programming language.

1) **High Level programming language**
It is programmer friendly language.
It can be easily understood by the programmer.
It is simple to debug.
It is simple to maintain.
It needs compiler or interpreter for translation

2) **Low Level programming language**
It is a machine friendly language (instructions will be in the form of 0s and 1s).
It is tough to understand by the programmer but it can be easily understood by the computers.
It is complex to debug comparatively.
It is complex to maintain comparatively.

**What can Python do?**
Python can be used to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems.
Python can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.

**Why Python?**
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Abundance of libraries and frameworks that facilitate coding and save development time.
It also boasts a large and active community of developers willing to provide advice and assistance through all stages of the development process.
